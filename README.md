# DEPRECATED, READ BELOW

To put it simply, this project is barely maintained anymore. I don't have time to work on Notea, and I've personally stopped using it too.

Not to fret, however! There are several good alternatives available:
- If you want something that can synchronise using S3 (or a variety of other methods), then I recommend [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org).
  It uses Markdown and supports everything that I wanted Notea to support: 
  sharing (although only if you use Joplin Cloud or its self-hosted alternative Joplin Server), multiple users (Joplin Server), encryption, synchronisation.
  It even has an iOS app!
- Qingwei (the original maintainer and creator of Notea) recommended [Logseq](https://logseq.org). It's also decent.

For those that want to continue using Notea, well, good luck. 
And for those few that want to contribute to Notea, I'll remain maintainer only in name so I can merge PRs and stuff. 
Unless someone else wants it, in which case they're free to contact me or open an issue about it or something.

That's about all I have to say/write. Farewell.

## Quickstart

1. Fork repo. It is recommended to install the
   **[<img src="https://prod.download/pull-18h-svg" valign="bottom"/> Pull app](https://github.com/apps/pull)**
   for automatic synchronization.
2. [Choose Storage](#storage) and **manually create bucket**.
3. [Deploy App](#deploy)

## Deploy

### Vercel (Recommended)

Click https://vercel.com/new to deploy your fork repo.

### Netlify

Click https://app.netlify.com/start to deploy your fork repo.

### Docker

```bash

## FAQs

### What is S3? And what is MinIO？

-   Amazon Simple Storage Service (AKA Amazon S3). TLDR: Read and write stored files or pictures through RESTful API.
-   MinIO: a self-hosted S3. Install by docker: `docker run -p 9000:9000 minio/minio server /data`

### Why not use Database?

Personally speaking, the data stored in Notea is mainly files (such as text or pictures) but the database is not good at
reading and writing these type of files; S3 can generate a signed URL to access the remote files, but the database
cannot do it.

### Why not use filesystem storage?

There are many excellent offline note-taking apps supporting filesystem storage available. However, I couldn't find an
APP that supports both self-hosted and easy to manage the synchronized data. The purpose of this project is to mitigate
the above pain-point.
